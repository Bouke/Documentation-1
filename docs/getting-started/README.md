# âš¡ Getting Started

To start hacking with Avalonia, install templates for it

```bash
dotnet new install Avalonia.Templates
```

> For .NET 6.0 and earlier `--install` option should be used instead.

Then create new application

```bash
dotnet new avalonia.app -o MyApp
cd MyApp
dotnet run
```

Now you can open MyApp folder and continue improving your application.
